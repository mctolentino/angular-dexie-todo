  <h2>Investigations of Query Binding for AngularJS and IndexedDB</h2>
  <p>For a recent project, I was looking at ways to have data in an
    AngularJS controller automatically update itself whenever
    IndexedDB transactions were committed. As a secondary goal, I was
    interested in shifting the burden of indexeddb-wrangling to a
    third party.</p>
  <p>For those that can't wait, here is
  <a href="https://github.com/pauleveritt/angular-dexie-todo">the code</a> and here is
  <a href="demo3/">the full demo</a>.
